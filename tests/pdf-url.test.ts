// Regression guard for a defect found on a real `research` run: arXiv serves its
// PDFs at `arxiv.org/pdf/<id>` with NO extension, so an extension-only test
// judged them HTML. Two consequences, both measured:
//   * the documented ladder (pdf-inspector → firecrawl → pdftotext → native) ran
//     out of order — fetchAndExtract hands a non-PDF to Firecrawl FIRST, so the
//     preferred rung never ran whenever a Firecrawl container was up;
//   * with the container down it cost a second round-trip per paper (fetch as
//     text, see the content-type, refetch as bytes).
// Fixing it took the same 10-paper run from 53s to 10s.
