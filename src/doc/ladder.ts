// The office-document extractor ladder: convert a fetched .docx/.pptx/.xlsx/…
// to Markdown, and REFUSE rather than cite what nothing could read.
//
// Same shape as the PDF ladder (../pdf/ladder.ts): try the strongest available
// tool, fall through when it is missing or its output fails the quality gate.
// The reason for refusing is starker here than for PDFs. An office document is
// a ZIP or an OLE stream, so the fallback that used to apply — hand back the
// response body as text — did not degrade the evidence, it fabricated it:
// hundreds of kilobytes of U+FFFD under a citation, with no note saying so.
//
// Rung order, and why:
//   1. anydoc     the only local converter for these formats. One npx download
//                 (~4 MB) the first time it is ever used, then a local cache hit.
//                 Reads the format from the BYTES, so a mislabelled file still
//                 converts — see ./formats.ts.
//   2. firecrawl  the caller's already-running container, injected as a callback
//                 so this module stays free of the client. Covers hosts without
//                 npm, and platforms npm has no anydoc binary for.
//
// There is deliberately no built-in last rung. For PDFs one exists because a
// text layer is plain enough to mine with zlib and a regex; unzipping OOXML and
// walking its parts is a different order of problem, and a wrong answer here is
// worse than no answer.
