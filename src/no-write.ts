// The no-write gate.
//
// Every command worth running persists something: a gather lays down a whole
// dossier directory, `render` an index.html/index.md pair, `brainstorm` a
// BRAINSTORM.md. That is the right default — the workflow is file-mediated, and
// the report tiers the model writes live beside the evidence it cites.
//
// It is also unusable in a read-only phase: a planning phase, a sandbox, any
// harness that forbids writes. There the caller wants one thing — real sources,
// read — and no report folder at all.
//
// So: one switch that every write in src/ passes through. Under it, an artifact
// is collected in memory instead of written, and the CLI streams what it would
// have written to stdout. The guarantee is a property of THIS module, not a
// promise each command has to keep individually — which is why even the writes
// belonging to commands that refuse to run in this mode (merge, fetch, verify,
// orchestrate) are routed here too.
//
// Note what this is NOT: a sandbox. It stops the writes the consuming skill
// performs; it cannot stop a caller redirecting stdout into a file. The point is
// that a plain invocation leaves the filesystem exactly as it found it.
