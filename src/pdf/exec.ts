// Run an external extractor with the PDF on stdin and its text on stdout.
//
// stdin/stdout rather than a temp file: every tool in the ladder supports `-`,
// and it keeps this dependency-free module from having to manage (and clean up)
// files. `node:child_process` is built into Node, so nothing enters package.json.
//
// A separate process is also what makes an external extractor SAFE to use: it
// cannot take the run down with it. That matters — the WASM build of
// pdf-inspector reproducibly crashes V8's background wasm compiler
// ("Fatal process out of memory: Zone"), which would kill a whole research run
// from inside the process. A child that dies is just a rung that failed.

// The npm specs the extractor rungs run through `npx`, pinned to a COMPATIBLE
// RANGE rather than left floating. One place to change, so the ladders and the
// `doctor` probes can never disagree about which version they are talking about.
//
// The range is what semver says is safe, which differs by major:
//   pdf-inspector is 1.x — minor and patch releases are backwards compatible,
//   so `@1` keeps picking up improvements.
//   anydoc is 0.x — under semver a 0.MINOR bump is allowed to break, and this
//   package is days old, so `@0.1` takes patches only. Widen it deliberately
//   after checking a 0.2 against tests/bench-pdf.ts, not by accident.
//
// Floating on `latest` was the previous behaviour and is a silent-failure risk:
// a breaking release would change what every dossier is grounded on, and a rung
// that starts emitting something new degrades quietly — the quality gate only
// catches garbage, not a subtly different extraction.
