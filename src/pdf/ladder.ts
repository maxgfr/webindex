// The PDF extractor ladder: try the strongest tool available, fall through when
// it is missing or its output fails the quality gate, and refuse rather than
// cite what nothing could read.
//
// Same shape as the discovery cascade (SearXNG → DuckDuckGo → … in gather.ts):
// stop at the first rung that returns something good enough. The difference is
// that "good enough" is decided by assessPdfText rather than a result count,
// because a bad PDF extraction is not empty — it is hundreds of kilobytes of
// plausible-looking garbage.
//
// Rung order, and why:
//   1. pdf-inspector  the best output by a wide margin (real Markdown, reading
//                     order, tables). Costs one ~6 MB npx download the first
//                     time it is ever used. Pinned to a compatible range rather
//                     than `latest` — see the specs in ./exec.ts.
//   2. anydoc         the same conversion, reached through the office-document
//                     converter (backends/doc/): anydoc embeds pdf-inspector for
//                     text PDFs, and on a real paper the two outputs differ by a
//                     single trailing newline. It sits here purely for platform
//                     coverage — npm publishes an anydoc binary for darwin-x64
//                     and pdf-inspector does not, so on an Intel Mac this is the
//                     rung that keeps PDFs readable without Docker or poppler.
//                     Costs nothing where rung 1 already worked: it only ever
//                     runs after rung 1 has failed.
//   3. firecrawl      the caller's already-running container. Covers hosts with
//                     no npm at all, and any platform neither binary is built
//                     for, because Docker runs the linux-x64 image there anyway.
//   4. pdftotext      poppler, if it happens to be installed. Fast, no network.
//   5. native         the built-in reader. Always present, frequently wrong;
//                     kept only so an offline machine with no tools at all still
//                     gets something, and gated hard by assessPdfText.
//   6. ocr            copyable-pdf + tesseract, if both are installed. The only
//                     rung that can read a page with NO text layer, which is
//                     precisely what every rung above it fails on. Last because
//                     it is the only expensive one (~2.7s per page), and it is
//                     budgeted per process — see ./ocr.ts.
