// OCR for scanned PDFs, through `copyable-pdf` (github.com/maxgfr/copyable-pdf).
//
// This is the last rung of the PDF ladder and the only one that can read a page
// with NO text layer. Every other rung mines a text layer that a scan simply
// does not have, so before this existed an image-only PDF could only ever be
// refused — honestly, but with the source contributing nothing.
//
// Three things make this rung different from the others, and all three are why
// it lives in its own module:
//
//   1. It takes a PATH, not stdin. `copyable-pdf` rasterises with pdftoppm and
//      reassembles with pdfunite, so it needs a real file. This module owns that
//      temp directory and removes it on every exit path, including a timeout.
//   2. It is EXPENSIVE — ~2.7s per page at the default 300 DPI on an M-series
//      Mac, so a 30-page scan is a minute. Hence a per-process budget (below):
//      one runaway document must not turn a 40-source run into an hour.
//   3. Its dependencies are checked HERE rather than by the tool. Asked for a
//      missing `tesseract`, copyable-pdf offers to run `brew install` /
//      `sudo apt-get install -y` and waits on stdin for a yes. A research run
//      must never install a system package as a side effect, so the rung is
//      skipped unless both binaries already resolve. (Closing stdin also makes
//      the prompt answer "no" on its own — this is the belt to that braces.)
