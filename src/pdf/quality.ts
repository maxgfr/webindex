// Is this extracted text fit to be cited?

// This is the rung test for both extractor ladders (see ./ladder.ts and
// ../doc/ladder.ts) AND the last gate before a converted document's text enters
// a dossier. It exists because the built-in PDF text-layer reader can hand back
// output that LOOKS like prose but isn't: a stream of image/font bytes that
// happened to inflate and contain `Tj`, or a CID-font page decoded through the
// wrong code map. Such text is long, non-empty and plausible, so nothing
// downstream catches it — `looksLikeJunkExtraction` only inspects the first 800
// chars of texts SHORTER than 2000 and only looks for consent/anti-bot walls.
//
// The same checks guard office documents, where the failure is cruder and used
// to be worse: a .docx is a ZIP, and decoding one as UTF-8 yields kilobytes of
// U+FFFD that sailed into dossiers as evidence until the document ladder began
// routing them here.
//
// A false positive costs one rung (we fall through to the next extractor, or
// keep the search snippet). A false negative puts fabricated evidence under a
// citation. So the checks below key on signals that essentially never occur in
// real prose, rather than on anything stylistic.
